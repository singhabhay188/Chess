# Chess Online | A multiplayer Game

## Hi there, Everyone I have created a online chess clone using: -
#### React for the Front End
#### Node JS Back End
#### Web Scokets for live communication
#### Chess JS for validation

### Overview
- Online game of chess
- Real time communication using Soket.io
- Chess logic using Chess Js
- Validation done so that only valid moves are allowed both at client and server side
- Spectator mode for third or more players


## There are too many flaws and bugs in the game. With Time I will try to fix them as soon as possible.
### Flaws
- No checkmate detection
- Queen Only promotion
- Basic UI
- No guidance options for moving for the player
